description: ORM for the Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate
---

If you are familiar with Laravel, you will find this ORM very familiar. It is a simple and easy-to-use ORM for WordPress.

You can find the ORM documentation [here](https://github.com/prappo/wp-eloquent)

Create your model in `includes/Models` folder.

Example: `includes/Models/Posts.php`

```php
<?php

namespace WordPressPluginBoilerplate\Models;

use Prappo\WpEloquent\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Posts extends Model {
	/**
	 * The table associated with the model.
	 *
	 * @var string
	 */
	protected $table = 'posts';

	/**
	 * The attributes that are mass assignable.
	 *
	 * @var array
	 */
	protected $fillable = array( 'post_title', 'post_content' );
}

```

You can access all your posts like this:

```php
$posts = Posts::all();
```

You can also create a new post like this:

```php
$post = Posts::create( array( 'post_title' => 'Hello World', 'post_content' => 'This is a test post' ) );
```

You can also update a post like this:

```php
$post = Posts::find( 1 );
$post->post_title = 'Hello World';
$post->save();
```

You can also delete a post like this:

```php
$post = Posts::find( 1 );
$post->delete();
```

You can also use the `where` method to filter your posts.

```php
$posts = Posts::where( 'post_title', 'like', '%hello%' )->get();
```

You can also use the `orderBy` method to sort your posts.

```php
$posts = Posts::orderBy( 'post_title', 'desc' )->get();
```
