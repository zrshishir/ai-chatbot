# Technical Instruction

## Project Overview
This is a wordpress plugin which is headless.

## Frontend
Frontend is built with React Tailwindcss ShadcnUI. Frontend code is located in `/js/frontend/` directory. `src/frontend/routes.jsx` file defines the routes for frontend. `src/frontend/main.jsx` is the main file which is loaded first.

## WordPressAdmin Panel
Admin panel is built with React Tailwindcss ShadcnUI. Admin panel frontend code is located in `/src/admin/` directory. `src/admin/routes.jsx` file defines the routes for admin panel. `src/admin/main.jsx` is the main file which is loaded first. 
The frontend route for admin panel is `http://your-domain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wordpress-plugin-boilerplate`. New pages routes will be like `http://your-domain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wordpress-plugin-boilerplate#your-page-slug`. It uses `react-router-dom` for routing which is defined in `src/admin/routes.jsx` file.

WordPress admin panel menu function is located in `includes/Admin/Menu.php` file.

## Rest API
We can fetch and manipulate data from backend with WP Rest API. Rest API structure is given below.

The route is defined in `includes/Routes/Api.php` file.
You can use this example to define new routes.

### Route Structure

```php
Route::method( 'your-prefix', 'your-endpoint', 'your-callback', $auth = false );
```

### RouteSyntax:

```php
 
Route::get( $prefix, $endpoint, $callback, $auth = false );
Route::post( $prefix, $endpoint, $callback, $auth = false );
 
// Multiple route in a prefix group.
Route::prefix( $prefix, function( Route $route ) {
    $route->get( $endpoint, $callback, $auth = false );
    $route->post( $endpoint, $callback, $auth = false );
});
```

### Route Callback

Route callbacks are functions defined as controller methods. Controller files are located in `includes/Controllers` directory.

## How to add new page to admin panel

* Create a new file in `src/admin/pages/{your-page-slug}.jsx` directory.
* Add a new route in `src/admin/routes.jsx` file.
* Import the new page component and register it in `src/admin/routes.jsx` file.
* Add a new menu item in `includes/Admin/Menu.php` file by copying the existing menu item and changing the name, slug, component etc based on the new page.
* If it needs to store any data in database then add a new model in `includes/Models/{YourCustomModel}.php` file. And migration file in `/database/migrations` directory.
* If it needs to manipulate data in database then add a new controller in `includes/Controllers/{YourCustomController}/Actions.php` file.
* To make connection between frontend and backend, add a new endpoint in `includes/Routes/Api.php` file.
* Alsway use javascript `fetch` function to fetch data from backend. Use `post` method to create/update/delete data.Use `get` method only for read-only purpose. The root url for api is `wordpressPluginBoilerplate.apiUrl + 'wordpressPluginBoilerplate/v1/{custom-route}'`.

## Adding a New Component

* Create a new file in `src/admin/components/{your-component-name}/` directory.
* Use the component in `src/admin/pages/{your-page-slug}.jsx` file.
* ShadcnUI components are located in `src/admin/components/ui` directory.

## Passing Data from Backend to Frontend as a JavaScript Object
* If you want to pass data from the backend to the frontend as a JavaScript object, add a key-value pair in includes/Frontend/Frontend.php in the get_data method. This data will be available in the frontend as the wordpressPluginBoilerplate object or the object defined in the const OBJ_NAME variable in Frontend.php.
